Website Sale Agent
==================

Allow eCommerce user to purchase items for a third party

If eCommerce user is marked as agent, the following changes:
- When creating a new address, the address will be without parent
(normally the parent would be current user), but the current user will be
marked as customer salesperson instead.
- When showing shipping addresses, the addresses with current user
as salesperson will be shown, instead of current user children addresses
